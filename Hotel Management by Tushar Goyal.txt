Hotel Management System as the name suggests is built to manage the working

of daily routines in a hotel. It is basically built on the tkinter module to

make it very user friendly. This gui is connected for data in backend with 

mysql workbench. Here I decided to make multiple windows to make the task easy.


******************************Modules used***********************************

1. tkinter 

2. mysql.connector         (pip install tkinter)

3. messagebox from tkinter

4. ttk in tkinter

5. random

6. Image, ImageTk from Pil     (pip install Pil)


*********************************Working***********************************

# Firstly I have made Main login page where user can login (login.py). 
  User can register here if not registered on clicking the register button.
  If he/she have forget his password then he can forget password it also.

	# If user clicks register button then he/she would be redirected to 
	  new window or register page (register.py)

	# On registering his/her details would be saved in the backend in a 
	  table. Only one username is allowed. Duplicate username would not
	  be allowed by the system.

	# On clicking the forget password button new window would be opened
          (forget_password.py). This window would not open till user have 
	  entered right username. Because why not registerd user want to 
	  reset password


# On the registration page after user can login from here (login_new.py).
  Or he/she if want can register another user if want, by resetting the
  details now.

	# On logining in with the new window or logining in from the user
 	  would be redirected to main page (hotel.py)


# hotel.py would open in a new window and have various buttons to interact with

	# This window have four working buttons which is used to open different
	  windows

	# Customer, Details, Room, Logout (report is not working now if 
	  am not able to think what to add in it)
	
	***************Customer window (customer.py)
	This window would allow user to add customer details like name, motherName,
	etc. This window have four buttons on left (add, update, delete, reset)
	Working of these windows is as same as the names suggests.

	Customer data is stored in the backend and would be used afterwards.
	This window contains means to search customer details on the basis of 4
	things. 

	Data searched would be showed on the table made in the downside


	****************Room Window (room.py)
	This window is used for adding the customer to a room. This window also contains
	buttons which have task as the name suggests. This window has a separate
	button called fetch data of customer. Which shows the data of the customer 
	on the right side empty space.

	Customer not added in system using previous window cannot be alloted to a
	room.

	This window have a generate bill button. Which fetches the data from backend
	of the customer and genrates the bill for the user of customer.

	***************Details Window (details.py)
	This window is created for the addition or deletion of a room from the database.
	For Ex. Customer a is registerd as a customer and is alloted a room 1 on floor
	1. Then for not making a error and alloting a new room to differnt customer, this
	room needs to be deleted in details window

	***************Logout window
	On clicking the logout button user would be loged out and program would get shut
